<h4>It has been too long</h4>

<p>Just because I stopped writing does not mean that I stopped riding...It is just that life got crazy, and than it got insane, and then it got horrible, and then it did not get better for a long long time. But maybe that is all starting to change now, we shall see.</p>

<p>We all know what happened in March of 2020 and we all have a shared grief over the 18 months or so that followed. I lost a friend to COVID. He left behind three kids and a wife...</p>

<p>It feels weird to put this out there on the internet, because it is so personal. I can assuage my anxiety a bit by thinking to myself <em>"Who is going to read this? Probably not that many people. So, what can it hurt?</em> <strong>My mother, Yvonne Tait, killed herself on October 26, 2020.</strong>Just when I thought 2020 could not get any worse it got much much worse.</p>

<p>So, yea life got shitty and then it got horribly f*$#ed a million miles past shitty. Odd thing is that the night my mom took her life I was out for a ride on my gravel bike. I was screaming down "CP Buffalo Hill" in the fading light when my front wheel hit a huge obstacle that I never saw. There was a horrendous bang and I thought for sure my wheel was jacked. I believe it was at that exact moment that my mom pulled the trigger. Her life ended and I kept riding, my bike and myself okay, oblivious to the carnage my mother had just caused...</p>

<p>The rage, anger, and despair I felt when I got the news was paralyzing. I ripped a door off its hinges and threw it against the wall. I walked out into the street and collapsed. I cried in my sleep. I drank a lot of whiskey. I got on a group call with my five siblings and we screamed and cried on speaker phone until the wee hours of the morning.</p>

<p>Back in 2015 I lost a friend to suicide, she was in high school. She was bright, a joy to be around, friendly, compassionate, and the world was her oyster. But I guess she did not see it that way. Suicide leaves a gapping hole and a lifetime of "whys" that will never be answered. One day I believe Jesus will answer those whys and heal those gapping wounds. But until then I will just keep moving one foot in front of the other - just like an ox pulling a heavy load...</p>
