<p>In regards to nutrition there is so much information out there. A lot of it is crap, some of it is good info, but most of it does not pertain to your specific needs. What a maddening situation!&nbsp;</p>

<p>To begin let me say that I have never been tested for Celiacs disease. Mostly because I&nbsp;just do not want to know the truth. Still I avoid as much gluten as I possibly can and when I do I feel SO much better. I have also had a lot of problems with a high FODMAP (Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides and Polyols) diet. So now I am on a low FODMAP diet. There are a lot of foods my body would just prefer for me not to ingest. As an endurance athlete this causes me a lot of problems. Then to add more problems to my diet I watched <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=12&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwib9dzGltrdAhUTIjQIHQhoAZ8QFjALegQICxAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.netflix.com%2Ftitle%2F80174177&amp;usg=AOvVaw3eukN1qy7tIbnleNKztDPt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"What The Health"</a> and now I feel compelled to not eat dairy or <span style="text-decoration: underline;">too</span> much meat.</p>

<p>So, as an endurance athlete with such a long list of "do not eats" what do I do for nutrition?&nbsp;</p>

<p>First let me say that I consider myself a&nbsp;<a href="https://drhyman.com/blog/2014/11/07/pegan-paleo-vegan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PEAGAN&nbsp;</a>with a non-comital side in regards towards gluten free&nbsp;<em>(I have been known to enjoy normal pasta or a flour tortilla with my burrito on occasion)</em>. For me balance is key, as is consuming locally grown organic foods or proteins that are ethically raised with no hormones or antibiotics.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gluten Free (GF) has come a long way since I first went GF. You can now enjoy pastas and breads. As part of the low FODMAP diet I have eliminated dairy. There are many great vegan options for butter and yogurt. I have found almond milk to be delicious (while almonds are high FODMAP they are not one of my triggers). For those days that I am craving a delicious bowl of shrimp alfredo I found <a href="http://girlandthekitchen.com/dairy-free-alfredo-sauce/" target="_blank">this </a>dairy free alfredo recipe that even my wife loves (alfredo pasta is her favorite food).</p>

<h4>Tracking food</h4>

<p>In an earlier&nbsp;<a href="http://157.230.153.196/cross-training/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a>&nbsp;I mentioned that my personal trainer Chris gave me some great pointers, including nutrition. One of the nutrition suggestions he gave was to check out the <a href="https://fnic.nal.usda.gov/fnic/dri-calculator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DRI Calculator</a>. I put together a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m4R8jZI4Do_n8EwS9kgiMDWEkUTMvJpRcw-E7lP9_8s/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spreadsheet </a>(if you would like to download it go ahead). The spreadsheet should be all set to compile your meal totals and daily totals. Using the DRI Calculator and my spreadsheet I calculated my daily food intake. Through this I was able to determine a few surprising things. My protein intake was too high while my carb and calorie intake was about half of what it should have been <em>(interestingly my fat intake was spot on)</em>. I was pleasantly surprised at my nutrition. Tracking my intake for a week helped me eliminate inefficient foods and find other foods that helped me meet my daily intake requirements.</p>

<p>Hmm cacti fruit... I wonder how many carbohydrates it has?</p>

<h4>Vitamins</h4>

<p>Earlier this summer I went for a four day <a href="https://www.cutthroattenkara.com/backpacking-tenkara-video/" target="_blank">backpacking </a>trip. It was the hardest physical effort I had ever done. Over four days we covered 70 miles. The temps hovered in the 90's for most of the trip. Day two we hiked a marathon with 40lb packs. The mosquitos were the stuff of nightmares. My feet were covered in blisters and four months later I still have not grown all my toe nails back. In other words it was a great trip. It was an experience that taught me not only a lot about myself emotionally and spiritually; but opened my eyes to the need for proper nutrition.</p>

<p>One of the biggest issues for me on that trip was my joints. By day two my knees and hips were in excruciating pain. I could not open my legs to take a full stride. I was relegated to hobbling. Back at home I overcame the issues with my joints by doing two things: strength training and taking daily <a href="https://www.gnc.com/mens-vitapaks/209811.html" target="_blank">GNC's Mega Men Joint vitamin pack</a>. It has been three going on four months now that I have taken daily vitamins, minerals, and fish oil&nbsp;and I have noticed a HUGE improvement in my overall health. My energy levels have also increased, so much so that I have <strong>completely</strong> stopped drinking coffee. As a stay at home dad with a toddler who wakes up anywhere&nbsp;between 0500 and 0630 this is saying something.</p>



<h4>Electrolytes &amp; BCAAs</h4>

<p>On the previously mentioned backpacking trip my buddy would hook me up with electrolyte pills when I was feeling particularly miserable. They helped immensely. So when I got home I purchased powdered electrolytes and BCAA (Branch Chained Amino Acids) powders to consume during and after my rides. I am a heavy sweater and I have noticed a quantifiable increase in not only energy during a ride but much faster recovery times. Before I started taking supplements I could be sore two or even three days after a hard ride. Now I feel great after a good nights sleep.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have experimented with several different kinds of BCAA powders. My favorites are <a href="https://gognarly.com/product/gnarly-bcaas-supplement/" target="_blank">Gnarly BCAAs Berry Lemonade</a> and <a href="https://www.gnc.com/shop-earth-genius/369716.html" target="_blank">Earth Genius PurEdge Recovery Lemon Tea</a>. I am a firm believer in not consuming fake sweeteners such as Sucralose. The aforementioned BCAA powders have &nbsp;Stevia and/or Cane Sugar. I have also tried the&nbsp;XTEND™ FREE BCAAs - Strawberry Kiwi but the flavor was putrid and I ended up returning it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As for electrolytes I use <a href="https://www.gnc.com/beyond-raw-chemistry-labs/369838.html?cgid=beyond-raw-chemistry-labs" target="_blank">Beyond Raw Chemistry Labs Electrolytes</a>. I have noticed a decrease in muscle cramps and lethargy since incorporating electrolytes into my during and post ride beverages.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Final thoughts</h4>

<p>Kind of random but the Trainer Roads <a href="https://www.active.com/nutrition/articles/why-every-athlete-should-have-pickle-juice" target="_blank">podcast </a>is great. I highly recommend checking them out.</p>

<p>Consuming ice cold pickle juice after a hot ride is straight up miraculous. Try it, even if you hate pickles. <a href="https://www.active.com/nutrition/articles/why-every-athlete-should-have-pickle-juice" target="_blank">Research </a>shows that it helps with reducing muscle cramping.&nbsp;</p>
