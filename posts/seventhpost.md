<p>As an entry level cyclist we are prone to make mistakes. Shoot even world class cyclists make mistakes. While everyone makes cycling mistakes it is&nbsp;important is to learn from them. Learning from other peoples mistakes is also a great way to learn. So in the spirit of sharing and because I like to spin a good yarn, let me tell you about the first time I rode up The Nate Harrison Grade...</p>

<h4>Cycling Mistakes</h4>

<p>It is early August and we are in the middle of heat wave number three or four. Inland temps are hovering in the low 100's and I want to go for a long ride. I have my eyes set on my first Hors Categorie climb called "The Nate Harrison Grade". Strava lists the stats at 1,281 meters (4,203') of elevation gain in 13.64km (~8.5 miles) with an average gradient of 9%. It is mostly a gravel road&nbsp;with a few sections of pavement and even some fairly rough dirt road segments.</p>

<h4>Before</h4>

<p>My alarm goes off the morning of but I am tired from staying up too late and drinking one glass of wine too many. So, I hit the snooze button. A more palpable time rolls around and I stumble out of bed. Breakfast consists of eggs and a hash brown (to help soak up the alcohol). I drink a little water to down my vitamins and head out into the heat to load the car.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The drive goes smoothly and I park a hundred meters or so from the beginning of&nbsp;The Nate Harrison Grade Strava segment. I have a Yeti cooler in the trunk loaded with ice, cold beverages and my two 20oz bottles for the ride. I stuff a few organic bars that I purchased at a gas station into my pockets as I forgot my Clif Bloks and Stinger Energy Chews at home.</p>

<h4>During</h4>

<p>The time is a little after 10am when I pedal away from my car and already the temps are hovering near 90. Within the first kilometer I consider bailing as my legs feel like lead and it is INSANELY hot. However, my stubborn streak comes through and I push on. Every 20 minutes or so I come across shade from a random bush but for the most part there is no shade and I am exposed to the full brunt and furry of the sun.</p>

<p>Just past the half way point I start to feel dizzy so I lay down in the middle of the road under the shade of a large oak. A truck comes by and I jump up. They ask if I am alright I stammer out a reply that I am.&nbsp;<em>Am I really?</em> I ask myself as they drive away.</p>

<p>Two kilometers from the top I run out of fluids.</p>

<p>One kilometer from the top there is a loud clunking noise coming from the rear end of my bike. I stop to investigate but cannot find the source, so I push on.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Topping Out</h4>

<p>I finally make it to the top and I am in desperate need of water. I ride around a little looking for a water spigot. Rather than waste my precious little energy searching for water I give up. It is a little cooler at the top, maybe low 90's and high 80's in the shade. </p>

<p>I find a shady spot and flip my bike wheels up and do a full diagnostic check. Eventually I discover that my rear derailleur hanger bolts have come loose, which is causing my&nbsp;derailleur to wobble side to side - the cause of the clunking noise. Unfortunately, at this time I discover that my new multi tool's 2.5mm allen wrench is not a perfect hex shape but more like a squished square. Holding the tool at a 45 degree angle to the bolt though I am able to tighten it just enough to keep the&nbsp;derailleur from wobbling.</p>


<p>The ride down is brutal. It is hot, the road is rough, I am wrecked, and my full rigid <a href="http://157.230.153.196/khs-grit-110/" target="_blank">bike</a>&nbsp;is beating my already pulverized body into smithereens. I stop occasionally on the way down to let my brakes cool off. At this point I have been an hour + with no water.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>After</h4>

<p>Finally back at the car I sucked down an ice cold Powerade from my cooler and rub ice over my head and neck. I start up the car and crank the AC while I load up and change out of my bike clothes. <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/GbYu7LxjHX12" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jilberto's Taco Shop</a>&nbsp;is just down the street so I stop in for lunch. Most of the bars I bought are still in my jersey pocket. They were too dry to eat with no water. After recharging with beans, rice, an enchilada and a taco I head home. On the drive I reflect on everything I did wrong, and what I should do differently next time.<br></p>

<h4>Reflection</h4>

<p>Mistakes in chronological order:</p>

<ol><li>Dinner the night before, while healthy had very little carbs.</li><li>I drank too much wine.</li><li>I went to bed late.</li><li>Knowing full well there was a heatwave I decided to sleep in.</li><li>Breakfast was low in carbs.</li><li>I did not drink enough water in the morning.&nbsp;</li><li>The car was parked too close to the beginning of the climb.</li><li>I only brought 40oz of fluids (20oz of water, 20oz of BCAA).</li><li>I forgot my on-the-bike nutrition at home.</li></ol>

<p>What I did right:</p>

<ol><li>I brought a cooler with ice and filled it with cold beverages.</li><li>Eh... I cannot think of anything else.</li></ol>

<p>That night my wife and I go out for dinner. It was a beautiful evening spent with lovely company over a delicious dinner. Among many things we talked a little about my ride. My wife said I was crazy. I agreed with her - but only because I was anxious to apply what I had learned to my next big ride.</p>
