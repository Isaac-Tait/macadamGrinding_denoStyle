<h2 class="aboutCenter">I bet you may be wondering what the heck macadam means... Well, it is a method of road construction pioneered by a Scotsman about 200 years ago using crushed stones (aka gravel). Since I am of Scottish descent and I enjoy cycling on gravel it seemed to be the perfect name for my blog.&nbsp;</h2>
